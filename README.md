# tau
This is a publicly-available repository for the surface soil moisture drydown time scale (\tau) dataset generated in McColl et al. (2017).

tau.mat is a Matlab file that contains data to reproduce Fig. 2 of McColl et al. (2017)

'tau_median' is the median estimated drydown at each grid cell.

'count_all' is the total number of drydowns used to estimate the median at each grid cell.

'lat' and 'lon' give the latitude and longitude of the grid cell, respectively.

Fig2.m is code for plotting Fig. 2 of McColl et al. (2017)
